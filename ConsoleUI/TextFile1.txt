2. ClassOptions

i>Properties

- Properties can be modified using full property.
- Constructor is used so that at least it allows whatvalue should be provided while instatntiating class also to 
	reduce code while instializing object
-If user doesnot want to provide values during instantiation of classes then we can create a constructor which
	doesnot accept any parameters. This is called method overloading. Console.Writeline() is a good example of 
	method overloading

*Prop Tip: In classes use auto property by default and move to full property when needed.
